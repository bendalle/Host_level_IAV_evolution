# This was used to call variants in the perth samples using the victorial plasmid control. Both perth and victoria samples were run in Run_1477 and so this comparison is valid and useful for determining our ability to infer variants.
 #   4 # Options for calling variants I have copied the Perth_mp plasmid to the perth fastq file in data/raw/victoria.
